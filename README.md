# Book Popularity Project 

This is a project I have done in Python to determine which types of books have the highest likelihood of being successful for a publishing company. This was done using a Jupyter 
notebook. I have included this file's background info, introduction, insights, and case. To see the code, feel free to click on the document. 

# Background Info

Before we proceed, I want to describe the world of publishing briefly. <br>
1) First, an author sells their manuscript to a publisher. <br>
2) If the publishing company likes it, they buy the book and work with the author to edit it. <br>
3) The book is published and available for sale once this process is finished. <br>
4) Book Publishers earn money through book sales, royalties, and various other publishing-related activities such as book fairs and book clubs. <br>
There is a lot more to publishing than this but, this is more than enough to understand the context of this project. <br>

# Intro 
Our client is a newly formed publishing company. They are currently in the process of finding their niche and deciding which books to publish. Using good reads data scrapped 
by SOUMIK(Kaggle User), we will determine which books are the most popular, and using this info, our client can decide which books to publish.

# Metrics
The Two metrics we will use to help measure popularity are the number of ratings and text reviews. More ratings and text reviews associated with a product give us a clear 
indicator of the popularity of that product. Although this does not consider actual ratings, this metric is irrelevant as almost all books in this data have high ratings.

# Insights

* Figures 1 and 2 show us which authors have the most ratings. What stands out the most is that these authors are fiction writers of some form. The most common genres among 
these authors are fantasy, sci-fi, romance, and literary criticism. <br>
* From Figure 3 and Figure 4, the top 10 titles with the most ratings and text reviews, respectively, all have the same thing in common: they are fiction titles, and most of 
these titles fall under the fantasy genre. <br>
* What the publishing companies in Figures 5 and 6 have in common is that the most common books that each of these books publish are fiction books. <br>
* From Figure 7, the most common book length is from 250-600 pages. Figure 8 shows that English books are by far the most popular kinds of books. <br>

# Recommendations

Based on the results of this analysis, If the primary goal of this company is to maximize profits, I advise that this company stay away from publishing non-fiction books 
and focus solely on fiction. In addition to this, the length of these books should be around 250-600 pages and in English. I recommend these genres be fantasy, and the 
specific fantasy type is unnecessary. It could be dark fantasy, romance fantasy, and science fantasy. In summary, the results of this analysis tell us that the book 
that will generate the most book sales and royalties will be some form of fantasy book in English with around 250-600 pages.
